    <h1>Mineral Exploration In Australia</h1>



    <p>In this visualisation, exploration expenditure refers to the cost during the exploring stage in mining.
        This cost includes exploration costs, engineering studies, construction of plants and more. The chart below
        shows the comparison of expenditure between states. Expenditure is measured in millions ($).

    <p>This chart shows the onshore vs offshore drilling. It compares how much of the exploration is on Austrslian 
        territorial lands, compared to the costal waters.
